Description: An interactive R Shiny tool for visualizing single-cell RNAseq clustering 
    results from the Seurat R package or any other analysis pipeline. Its main goal is 
    two-fold: A: to help select a biologically appropriate resolution or K from clustering
    results by assessing differential expression between the resulting clusters; and B: 
    help annotate cell types and identify marker genes.
